I've been into skating for years now, skateboarding/longboarding, roller skating, even skiing and snowboarding (not 
technically skating but you get the idea).
Everytime you go to the roller disco, or any nighttime event, everyone has got some fancy light set up or light up 
wheels, or glow in the dark skates etc.


I've always wanted to be able to go and show off some cool lights while im doing tricks or dancing or even just rolling
about, the issue I was facing was that as always, I wanted to go big or go home.
What did this mean? Well multiple years ago i attempted (and failed) a 
[project](https://learn.adafruit.com/firewalker-led-sneakers/overview) from adafruit. Where they attached an LED strip 
to the outside of the soles of the shoes, then added a microcontroller to do some very cool stuff. More on that later.

When I attempted this project everything just kept going wrong between one thing or another, I wasn't prepared, 
I didn't have the equipment and I didn't know what I was doing. Now only one of those is true. I remember very vividly 
the panic first faced when soldering without any way to hold any components or clean the iron.
What this project did do was make me pretty comfortable to mess around with electronics and other such adjacent tech, 
microcontrollers, LEDs, etc. 
But the moment I thought about light up skates my mind immediately was back in this project.

I knew what the plan had to be before i'd even written out or drawn anything. I was going to make a pair of interactive 
LED rigs for my skates. The how and why were vague, but the drive was there. From there I made a pretty shaky design for
a 3D printed box that would clip into my skates, this was really not a great idea it broke everytime you tried to insert
or remove it from the skate. The circuit was alright and the code was okay too. I think this was probably about 4 years 
ago, since then I managed to damage my knees quite badly and have been in recovery since.
With my recent return to skating my love for this project was reignited, now with more time and resources, 
a better attempt can be made.

The only working proof of the previous design.
