Im just going to put it out there, Im not a huge fan of light up wheels for myself, it can degrade the wheel performance
and in general they are just lower spec. The best light set-ups I've seen utilize LEDs and small coin batteries.

A bit of context about my skates and why this is a particularly difficult challenge. I skate a pair of Bont Quadstar
[boots](https://europe.bont.com/collections/roller-derby-skates/products/quadstar-carbon-roller-derby-skates?variant=46913449001302) on 
some Suregrip Avenger [plates](https://www.olisskateshop.co.uk/Sure-Grip-White-Avenger-Magnesium-Plate), the boots are like
skin tight plimsolls that have been heat moulded to the form of my feet, they 
don't have a heel and as such the plates are mounted flat. This gives zero room between the boot and the plate that you
may be able to use in a normal heeled set up.

So with no space where is this rig meant to live? Well, the avenger plates have one very cool weight reducing feature,
where they have the entire center of the plate carved out all the way to the boot. This means there is ample room to fit
some kind of power supply or chip, maybe enough for both, but not much more.

Okay but we still need somewhere to house the LED strip and potentially add a diffusing sheet to shield the raw LEDs.
As well as some way to attach the rig to the skate securely, it would be incredibly inappropriate to have some device
fall off a skate and then cause **someone** **else** to trip up or injure themselves.

Originally the plan had been to make a clip like object with a box attached to it, this was going to clip in "long-ways"
but in the end the strength of the clip was never enough, it would always snap or break anytime it was handled too much.
Also the only power source small enough and available at the time was a coin cell battery, since then drone piloting has
become much more popular and lipo batteries of any size have become widely available.
